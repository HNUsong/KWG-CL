# KWG-CL
This is a continual learning dataset for 2D grasping in kitchen waste sorting scenarios. 
# Introduction
This dataset is built upon the [KWG2024](https://github.com/HNUsong/KWG2024) and the [Xrobot](https://github.com/TDA-2030/XRobot)-based robotic system. Specifically, we trained the grasping model on KWG2024, allowing the Xrobot-based system to autonomously grasp and label targets. The labels were then manually reviewed and corrected to create the KWG-CL dataset. This dataset is divided into 5 tasks. According to the task ID number, the complexity of the image background will gradually increase.
